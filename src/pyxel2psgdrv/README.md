# pyxel2psgdrv.py

## Overview

This script converts sound data created with Pyxel to msx-PSGSoundDriver format.
Based on the MUSIC and SOUND data in Pyxel, output the Z80 assembler source code available in msx-PSGSoundDriver.

Supported function are as follows:
- Supports to z88dk assembler code only.
- NOIZE is not supported
- EFX is not supported

I created this script because the conversion tool included with msx-PSGSoundDriver is exclusive to LovelyComposer and could not be used on macOS.
Confirmed to work on macOS Ventura 13.2 (M1 Mac).

## Execution Sample

- Required.
Python 3.10 or higher is required.
The .pyxres file must exist in the same directory as the script.
You must create the directory to be output by the script (e.g., mkdir . /extract)

% mkdir extract
% python pyxel2psgdrv.py -res ./sample.pyxres -o ./extract -f

Conversion success.
The following ASM files were generated by converting the Pyxel sound data.
./extract/pyxel_resource/music0.asm
./extract/pyxel_resource/sound04.asm
./extract/pyxel_resource/sound01.asm
./extract/pyxel_resource/sound00.asm
./extract/pyxel_resource/sound02.asm
./extract/pyxel_resource/sound03.asm

## Using the output sources

The music*.asm file can be used directly as a sound source for msx-PSGSoundDriver.
